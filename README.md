# ⚓ Riverbraid-Golds: The Hub

This is the **Master Authority** for the Riverbraid Gold Cluster. It holds the `STATIONARY_MANIFEST.json` which maps the immutable state of all 7 petals.

## 🌻 The 7 Petals of the Braid
1.  **Riverbraid-Core**: Foundational primitives.
2.  **Riverbraid-Golds**: This Hub (Manifest Authority).
3.  **Riverbraid-Crypto-Gold**: Cryptographic anchor (SHA-256).
4.  **Riverbraid-Judicial-Gold**: Rule-centric policy enforcement.
5.  **Riverbraid-Memory-Gold**: Stationary state persistence.
6.  **Riverbraid-Integration-Gold**: Semantic bridging.
7.  **Riverbraid-Harness-Gold**: The Verification Harness.

## 📜 Global Directions
To verify the cluster, pull all repositories and run the `harness` audit. If the Merkle Root does not resolve to `de2062`, the cluster is compromised.
