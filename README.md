# Riverbraid Gold Cluster v1.1
## Sovereign Cognitive Architecture

This cluster is a physical manifestation of the **Rule-and-Anchor** principle.

### The Invariant Map
* **Core:** Signal Root
* **Crypto:** Truth Anchor
* **Judicial:** Governance Gate
* **Memory:** Persistence
* **Safety:** Alignment Filter
* **Refusal:** Boundary Logic
* **Integration:** Harmonic Rest

---
**Status:** STATIONARY | **Tier:** GOLD | **Protocol:** HONEST_ADVISOR

### Cluster Management
This monorepo uses **Git Submodules**. 
* To clone with all petals: `git clone --recursive [URL]`
* To verify cluster coherence: `./braid-sync.sh`

### The Gate Logic
Every package contains a `verify.mjs` script. This is the **Fail-Closed** mechanism. If a petal drifts from its assigned Invariant (defined in its local README), the `braid-sync.sh` will fail, preventing the deployment of incoherent intelligence.
