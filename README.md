# Riverbraid Gold Cluster v1.1
## Sovereign Cognitive Architecture

This cluster implements the **Absolute V2 (Refined) Standard**. It is a deterministic, rule-centric intelligence system designed to scale in coherence, not in raw compute.

### 🛡️ The Absolute V2 Pipeline
The system operates through a single linear gate:
1. **Hygiene**: Scans for illicit entropy and "AI-Generic" distortion.
2. **Assemble**: Synchronizes Gold-tier invariants via submodules.
3. **Build**: Validates the thermodynamic signal (Meaning > Tokens).
4. **Vectors**: Exports validated predicate-based logic for deployment.

### 🧩 The Gold Petals
* **Crypto-Gold**: SHA-256 state anchoring.
* **Judicial-Gold**: Fail-closed predicate governance.
* **Refusal-Gold**: Cognitive control and boundary logic.
* **Memory-Gold**: Meaning-centric persistence.
* **Safety-Gold**: Real-time alignment and distortion filtering.
* **Core**: Signal root coordination.

### 🚀 Usage
```bash
# Clone the complete braid
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Riverbraid/Riverbraid-Golds.git

# Execute the Absolute V2 Pipeline
npm run build

# Verify local stationary state
./braid-sync.sh
```

### Invariant Contract
Every module in this cluster is gated by a `verify.mjs` script. If a module's internal state drifts from its mathematical anchor, the system enters a **Fail-Closed** state and refuses execution.

## 📜 The Gold Invariants (v1.1)
This cluster operates under a **Fail-Closed** discipline. Coherence is maintained through four primary logical gates:

### 1. The Coupling Test
A petal is considered valid only if its **Internal Meaning** is computationally coupled to its **Thermodynamic Signal**.
* **Requirement:** `node verify.mjs` must return `exit(0)` only when the `README.md` contains the specific Invariant Status marker.
* **Failure Mode:** Any drift in the signature triggers an immediate system-rest state.

### 2. Scale Separation Gate
Logic is bifurcated to prevent complexity bleed:
* **Root Level:** Manages **Contextual Coherence** and the Navigation Map.
* **Petal Level:** Manages **Executable Logic** and specific Boundary Rules.

### 3. State Definitions
* **Linear Tags:** `hygiene` → `assemble` → `build` → `vectors`.
* **Nonlinear Tags:** The `Riverbraid` essence—meaning as primary, tokens as secondary.

### 4. Stationary State Invariant
Meaning is defined as the internal frequency of a system successfully navigating environmental entropy:

$$M = F_{int}
