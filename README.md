# Riverbraid Gold Cluster v1.1
## Sovereign Cognitive Architecture

This cluster implements the **Absolute V2 (Refined) Standard**. It is a deterministic, rule-centric intelligence system designed to scale in coherence, not in raw compute.

### 🛡️ The Absolute V2 Pipeline
The system operates through a single linear gate:
1. **Hygiene**: Scans for illicit entropy and "AI-Generic" distortion.
2. **Assemble**: Synchronizes Gold-tier invariants via submodules.
3. **Build**: Validates the thermodynamic signal (Meaning > Tokens).
4. **Vectors**: Exports validated predicate-based logic for deployment.

### 🧩 The Gold Petals
* **Crypto-Gold**: SHA-256 state anchoring.
* **Judicial-Gold**: Fail-closed predicate governance.
* **Refusal-Gold**: Cognitive control and boundary logic.
* **Memory-Gold**: Meaning-centric persistence.
* **Safety-Gold**: Real-time alignment and distortion filtering.
* **Core**: Signal root coordination.

### 🚀 Usage
```bash
# Clone the complete braid
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Riverbraid/Riverbraid-Golds.git

# Execute the Absolute V2 Pipeline
npm run build

# Verify local stationary state
./braid-sync.sh
```

### Invariant Contract
Every module in this cluster is gated by a `verify.mjs` script. If a module's internal state drifts from its mathematical anchor, the system enters a **Fail-Closed** state and refuses execution.

## 🛡️ Sovereign Spec: The Gold Invariants (v1.1.2)

### I. The Coupling Invariant
**Predicate:** Coherence ($) exists if and only if Internal State ($) ≡ External Signal ($).
* **Enforcement:** `node verify.mjs`
* **Target:** Regex match on "\[Signal: .* | Braid: CLOSED-LOOP\]"
* **Consequence:** Non-binary outcome is prohibited. If  
eq S_e$, the system executes `process.exit(1)`.

### II. Scale Separation Protocol
**Constraint:** Entropy bleed across scopes is a system failure.
* **Root Scope:** Global Invariants, Cross-Petal Navigation.
* **Petal Scope:** Internal Executable Logic, Local Protocol Steps.

### III. Thermodynamic Meaning (The Anchor)
Meaning ($) is the internal frequency ($) required to navigate environmental entropy ($
abla S$).
