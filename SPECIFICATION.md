# Riverbraid Gold V1.1 Formal Specification

## 1. The Coupling Test
- All petals must fail-closed if the Core secret is rotated or missing.

## 2. Scale Separation Gate
- Reasoning is local; Verification is global. Raw compute does not bypass rule-anchors.

## 3. Linear vs Nonlinear Tags
- Linear: Token generation.
- Nonlinear: Meaning-centric persistence.

## 4. Stationary State Invariant
- The system does not seek more data. It seeks higher coherence within its existing constraints.
