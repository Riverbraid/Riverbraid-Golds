# Riverbraid Organization Manifest
> Version: 1.1.0 | Status: Stationary | Merkle Root: de2062

## 🌌 Philosophy
Riverbraid is a governance-locked cognitive architecture designed to move from dataset-centric extraction to rule-and-anchor-centric intelligence. It enforces a stationary state where meaning is primary and tokens are secondary.

## 🏗️ Architecture: The Gold Cluster
The cluster consists of a foundational substrate and seven specialized deterministic petals.

## ⚖️ Rules for AI Interaction
1. No Adaptive Drift: Reject all suggestions for non-deterministic logic.
2. Fail-Closed: All functions must default to 'Rest'.
3. Stationary Integrity: Reconcile against Merkle Root (de2062).
